✈️ Airfare Insights – Analyzing Indian Flight Prices and Patterns
This project explores factors affecting airfare pricing in the Indian domestic flight market. Using a real-world dataset of airline ticket prices, we apply data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical methods, and SQL queries to uncover pricing trends and generate actionable insights for both customers and airlines.

🔍 Problem Statement
What drives flight fare variation in India?

We investigate how features such as airline, number of stops, duration, route, and departure/arrival times impact ticket pricing.

📊 Key Tasks & Tools
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Time & duration conversions, missing value handling

EDA (Python – Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn): Distributions, outlier detection, visual trends

Statistical Analysis:

T-tests and ANOVA for price differences

Correlation analysis between duration and price

Chi-square tests for categorical associations

SQL Insights: Aggregated pricing trends, identifying anomalies

Visualization: Price trends across airlines, routes, stops (Seaborn/Plotly/Power BI)

📁 Deliverables
Cleaned CSV dataset

Jupyter notebook with all analysis

SQL scripts for querying

Visual dashboard
